# Linear Regression with scikit-learn

### Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the target variable based on the input features.

### Dataset 
For this project i have downloaded a csv file named "bottle1.csv" which is available free on internet 


### Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- Model Training: A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data using scikit-learn's LinearRegression class.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the testing data using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
